# CTF Notes

A collection of notes, tools, and techniques, mostly for my own use. At the moment, many of these files are unfinished. This is also all pretty basic and shouldn't be used as a guide by anyone. I am not a professional and am only interested in penetration testing and so forth from the perspective of someone who would like to do work on the blue team side of things at some point.
