# What is OSINT?

OSINT stands for "open source intelligence." Simply put, this is the practice of finding things that are openly available on the internet. Sometimes all you need is a simple google search; sometimes more advanced tools and technical knowledge are needed. This file provides links for some of the most common tools.

## Google Dorking

These are ways to filter out irrelevant results when performing Google searches. Boolean operators are probably familiar to most people.

`AND` gets results that contain both of the keywords or phrases you're looking for. For example: `cows AND ducks`

`OR` gets results that contain either of the keywords you're interested in: `cows OR ducks`

Google's algorithm is powerful but has become difficult to use thanks to aggressive advertising. Luckily, there are others out there.

## The Wayback Machine

[The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) archives data that was once publicly available on the internet but may have since been removed. To use it, enter the URL you're interested in using the search box. You can then browse all available captures of that URL, which will show you if the site looked different in the past.
