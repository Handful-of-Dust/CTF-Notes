# Geolocation

Geolocation challenges occasionally show up in CTF competitions that have some sort of OSINT element. Unless the subject of the CTF is OSINT, they are not usually very difficult. Below is my general methodology for dealing with them.

## Look for metadata

Sometimes the coordinates at which an image was taken are in the image and it really is just that easy.

## Look for words (or at least letters) in the image

The language of any signage displayed in the image can often help you narrow it down to a country or region. License plates can give you clues, though they aren't a deciding factor unless you see quite a few of them and they're all from the same location. Names of roads and highways are very useful, especially if you can identify an intersection. If you see the name of a business, google it. You should also look for numbers (phone number area codes can help narrow it down). If any of these things are present, they should give you enough data to do some google searching and form at least a general idea of where the image was taken.

## Look for landmarks, such as distinctive buildings or monuments

If you already have a good idea of the general vicinity of the image, you can google something like "parks near ___" or "downtown cityname." You might even be ready to pull out Google Earth and start looking for something that matches the image. You could also skip Step 2 and use Google Lens to look for other images showing this landmark, which might turn up tourism websites or news articles that explain where this thing is.

## Look for other context clues

These could include:

* The color and shape of lines painted on roads, if any are visible
* Vegetation in the image (Google Lens, or other image searching tools, can be helpful here)
* Architectural styles
* Types of clothing worn by people in the image, if visible
* Landscape and geological features
* Types of vehicles
