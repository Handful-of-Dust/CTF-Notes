# Encoding data

When data is encoded, it's really just put in a different format so that it can be processed in some way by a computer. Encoding is easily reversible and not at all the same thing as encryption, where the goal is to prevent data from being read by anyone who isn't authorized to access it, but it still shows up in easy cryptography challenges sometimes. Again, CyberChef is probably the easiest way to tackle most of these challenges, but there are command line tools that you can use (and should probably know how to use just in case) as well.
